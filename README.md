## Documentation mirror

This is the documentation mirror for [use.no.de](http://use.no.de).

The content is generated from the [usenode/use.no.de](https://github.com/usenode/use.no.de) project.

## Updating

Make changes in the main [usenode/use.no.de](https://github.com/usenode/use.no.de) project, then still in that project run:

    make ghpages

The `Makefile` will run the site, generate the markup into `.html` files and finally push into the `gh-pages` branch of this project.
